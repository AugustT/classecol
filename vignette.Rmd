When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```
library(devtools)
install_github("GitTFJ/classecol")
library(classecol)
```


```
#dir.create("models")
#download_models("models")
```


```
use_python("C:/Users/mn826766/Anaconda3/python.exe")
direc = paste(getwd(),"/", "models/classecol-models-master/", sep = "")
model_directory = r_to_py(direc)
```


```
df = data.frame(text = c("Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and @Conservatives
 leader. Member of Parliament for Uxbridge and South Ruislip. #StayAlert", "Quantitative ecologist interested in conservation & population dynamics. Lecturer at University of Reading, UK. She/her", "University of Reading"))
data = reticulate::r_to_py(df)
bio_class(
  type = "join",
  directory = direc)
```


```
df = data.frame(text = c("I hate hunting", "Cant wait to go hunting", "Hunting for my car keys"))
data = reticulate::r_to_py(df)
hunt_class(
  type = "all",
  directory = direc)
```

```
df = data.frame(text = c("I love walking in nature", "I am so sad we losing the rainforest. stop the destruction", "Tiger wins the PGA tour again"))
df$text = classecol::clean(df$text)
sm = as.matrix(cbind(
  valence(df$text), 
  lang_eng(as.character(df$text)), 
  senti_matrix(as.character(contract(df$text)))))
data = reticulate::r_to_py(df)
sent_mat = reticulate::r_to_py(sm)
env_class(
  type = "trim",
  directory = direc)
```
