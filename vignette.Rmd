library(classecol)
library(reticulate)
```


```
#dir.create("models")
#download_models("models")
```


```
df = data.frame(text = c("Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and @Conservatives
 leader. Member of Parliament for Uxbridge and South Ruislip. #StayAlert", "Quantitative ecologist interested in conservation & population dynamics. Lecturer at University of Reading, UK. She/her", "University of Reading"))
direc = paste(getwd(),"/", "models/classecol-models-master/", sep = "")
```


```
use_python("C:/Users/mn826766/Anaconda3/python.exe")
data = r_to_py(df)
model_directory = r_to_py(direc)
bio_class(
  type = "full",
  directory = direc)
```
