classecol is a package to perform text classiÔ¨Åcations of twitter data (but may be useful for any social media text). It provides a series of functions to clean data, produces a sentiment matrix of some of the most popular methods, and has three models to classify text: biographical - to assess who the user is, environment - to assess if the tweet is related to their environment at the users stance on the enviornment, hunting - to assess if the tweet is related to hunting and determine their stance on hunting.
